\section{Introduction}

In this report I will describe the database design for a web-based collaboration app \textit{snickr}, which similar to Slack, is comprised of workspaces and channels in which users can communicate. First, I will outline the relational schema and its corresponding ER diagram. I will also give an equivalent database schema for MariaDB (an open-source variant of MySQL) that implements this design. Afterward, I will show example queries on the schema using test data. Finally, I will describe the web application that uses this database on the backend to implement the communication system.

\section{Relational Schema}
{
\ttfamily
\noindent
User(\underline{uname}, nickname, email, password) \\
Workspace (\underline{wsname}, description) \\
Wsmember(\underline{wsname}, \underline{uname}, admin) \\
Channel(\underline{chname}, \underline{wsname}, owner, chtype) \\
Chmember(\underline{chname}, \underline{wsname}, \underline{member}) \\
WSInvitation(\underline{wsname}, \underline{invitee}, inviter) \\
CHInvitation(\underline{wsname}, \underline{chname}, \underline{invitee}) \\
Message(\underline{msgid}, chname, wsname, sender, content)

\noindent
\textnormal{Foreign Keys:}

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
Wsmember(uname)                 & references & User(uname) \\
Wsmember(wsname)                & references & Workspace(wsname) \\
Channel(wsname, owner)          & references & Wsmember(wsname, uname) \\
Chmember(chname, wsname)        & references & Channel(chname, wsname) \\
Chmember(wsname, owner)         & references & Wsmember(wsname, uname) \\
WSInvitation(invitee)           & references & User(uname) \\
WSInvitation(wsname, inviter)   & references & Wsmember(wsname, uname) \\
CHInvitation(wsname, chname)    & references & Channel(wsname, chname) \\
CHInvitation(wsname, invitee)   & references & Wsmember(wsname, uname) \\
Message(wsname, chname, sender) & references & Chmember(wsname, chname, member) \\
\end{tabular}
}

For readability (and brevity) I have omitted the timestamp field of each table. (These are included in the schema shown in \Cref{lst:schema}.)

Instead of using a globally unique channel id, each channel is uniquely identified by the tuple (\texttt{chname}, \texttt{wsname}). This allows us to ensure that a user can only be made a member of a channel if \ze is a member of the channel's workspace simply by checking a foreign key constraint.

I chose to make the \texttt{msgid} globally unique, as opposed to only unique in a channel, since it shortens the primary key, and doesn't limit the power of the database to make efficient integrity checks.

Additionally I have chosen to model the direct channel in the same way that the public and private channels are modeled. This will rely on the web application to ensure that direct channels only have 2 members at all times. The name of the direct channel can be some text encoding of the 2 usernames containing characters that are not allowed in regular channel names, which will ensure that the chname is available. This could be achieved more rigorously by using a separate modeling, but would increase the complexity and presents a design tradeoff. I chose this approach because the model still has enough expressive power, without the added complexity.

\section{ER Diagram}

\Cref{fig:er} shows the ER diagram of the design.

 \begin{figure}[!ht]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{dber}
 	\caption{The ER diagram.}
 	\label{fig:er}
\end{figure}

There are a few notes to make on this ER diagram. Firstly, while this ER diagram suggests that the primary key for Channel should be (\texttt{uname}, \texttt{wsname}, \texttt{chname}), in reality the primary key is (\texttt{wsname}, \texttt{chname}) since we want to enforce that a channel name is unique to a workspace. That said, the channel table does have a foreign key for (\texttt{uname}, \texttt{wsname}) referencing \texttt{Wsmember} (\texttt{uname}, \texttt{wsname}) since we want to enforce that a user can only create a channel for workspaces that \ze is a member.

\section{MariaDB Schema}

\Cref{lst:schema} below shows the MariaDB schema for the database design. It follows directly from the Relational Schema.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Database Schema,label=lst:schema]{../sql/schema.sql}

I decided to use \texttt{enum} for the \texttt{chtype} field in the \texttt{channel} table since there are only 3 possible values. It is also more space efficient and performant then using \texttt{varchar}.

I chose varchar(64) as the length for the name fields, but this could be shorter or longer as needed in practice.

I have used \texttt{on delete cascade} for all foreign key constraints, since for testing purposes it is convenient to remove all orphaned data. In practice, it may be more prudent to keep the orphaned data for other uses, depending on the needs of the organization using the system.

\section{Test Dataset}

The test data is shown in \Crefrange{tbl:user}{tbl:message} and consists of 2 workspaces, generically named \textit{job} and \textit{baseball}. There are users that in both workspaces, neither workspace, and in just one of the workspaces. Each channel also has a private and public channel, with some users being in both or neither.

\section{Example Queries}

In this section I will implement some basic queries, and show the results for the test dataset.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Create a new user account, with email, name, nickname, and password.
\begin{lstlisting}
insert into user(email, uname, nickname, password) values
('dsalomon@nyu.edu', 'dms833', 'dov', 'password123');
\end{lstlisting}

\item
Create a new public channel inside a workspace by a particular user.
\begin{lstlisting}
insert into channel(wsname, chname, owner, chtype) values
('job', 'random', 'dms833', 'public');
\end{lstlisting}

The foreign key constraint guarantees that dms833 is a member of the job workspace.

\item
For each workspace, list all current administrators.
\begin{lstlisting}
select wsname, uname
from wsmember
where admin;
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+----------+--------+
| wsname   | uname  |
+----------+--------+
| baseball | sam    |
| baseball | trisha |
| job      | george |
| job      | sam    |
+----------+--------+
\end{verbatim}

\item
For each public channel in a given workspace, list the number of users that were invited to join the channel more than 5 days ago and that have not yet joined.
\begin{lstlisting}
select chname, invitee
from channel join invitation using(wsname, chname)
where wsname = 'baseball'
and chtype = 'public'
and timestampdiff(day, invited, current_timestamp()) >= 5
and (wsname, chname, invitee) not in (
  select wsname, chname, member
  from chmember
);
\end{lstlisting}

The last part of the where clause is not necessarily needed, assuming that an invitation is automatically removed when the user accepts the invitation and is added to the channel.
\begin{verbatim}
+---------+---------+
| chname  | invitee |
+---------+---------+
| general | dorothy |
+---------+---------+
\end{verbatim}

Note that george is not listed here since he was invited to a public channel in the baseball workspace, not a private one.

\item
For a particular channel, list all messages in chronological order
\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content
from message
where wsname = 'job'
and chname = 'general'
order by posted;
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+-------+----------------------------+
| msgid | content                    |
+-------+----------------------------+
|     1 | When is the staff meeting? |
|     2 | In 10 minutes.             |
|     3 | That is perpendicular      |
+-------+----------------------------+
\end{verbatim}

\item
For a particular user, list all messages they have posted in any channel.
\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content, wsname, chname
from message
where sender = 'george';
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+-------+-----------------------------------------+--------+----------+
| msgid | content                                 | wsname | chname   |
+-------+-----------------------------------------+--------+----------+
|     2 | In 10 minutes.                          | job    | general  |
|     4 | What is happening at the staff meeting? | job    | managers |
+-------+-----------------------------------------+--------+----------+
\end{verbatim}

\item
For a particular user, list all messages that are accessible to this user and that contain the keyword “perpendicular” in the body of the message.
\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content
from message join chmember using(wsname, chname)
where chmember.member = 'george'
and content like '%perpendicular%';
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+-------+-----------------------+
| msgid | content               |
+-------+-----------------------+
|     3 | That is perpendicular |
+-------+-----------------------+
\end{verbatim}

We can also try out this query for a few other users.

\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content
from message join chmember using(wsname, chname)
where chmember.member = 'trisha'
and content like '%perpendicular%';
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+-------+----------------------------+
| msgid | content                    |
+-------+----------------------------+
|     8 | I will pitch perpendicular |
+-------+----------------------------+
\end{verbatim}

\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content
from message join chmember using(wsname, chname)
where chmember.member = 'har'
and content like '%perpendicular%';
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
+-------+----------------------------+
| msgid | content                    |
+-------+----------------------------+
|     3 | That is perpendicular      |
|     8 | I will pitch perpendicular |
+-------+----------------------------+
\end{verbatim}

The following has no output since dorothy is not in any channels.
\begin{lstlisting}
select msgid, content
from message join chmember using(wsname, chname)
where chmember.member = 'dorothy'
and content like '%perpendicular%';
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Web App}

The web application is built in python using the \textbf{flask} platform. As mentioned previously, the database on the back-end is \textbf{MariaDB}, and I use the \textbf{pymysql} library to communicate between flask and MariaDB. On the front-end, I am using jinja templates, Bootstrap CSS, as well as React for the real-time chat application itself.

\subsection{Server}

\noindent The url endpoints for the server are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  /login

  GET: Fetch login form

  POST: Submit login form and authenticate user. Redirects the user to / if successfully authenticated

\item
/register

  GET: Fetch the registration form

  POST: Submit the registration form and create user

\item
/

  GET: Fetch all workspaces and pending invitations

  POST: Create a workspace

\item
/\textless workspace \textgreater

  GET: Fetch all channels available to user, and all members in workspace

  POST: Create a new channel in workspace

\item
/\textless~workspace~\textgreater~/admin?u=\textless~user~\textgreater

  GET: Make user an admin in workspace

\item
/\textless workspace \textgreater /invite

  GET: Fetch the invite form to workspace

  POST: Submit the invite form, create the workspace invitation

\item
/\textless~workspace~\textgreater~/~\textless~channel~\textgreater

  GET: Fetch the React app to begin chatting in channel

\item
/\textless~workspace~\textgreater~/~\textless~channel~\textgreater/invite

  POST: invite a user to (private) channel

\item
/\textless~workspace~\textgreater~/direct/\textless~user\textgreater

  GET: Fetch the React app to chat in a direct channel with user

\item
/logout

  GET: Logout the user

\end{itemize}

In general the user does not need to worry about all these details, since the web layout is fairly intuitive. The correct links are generated and labeled properly, so that the user does not need to type in any urls manually.

\Cref{fig:workspaces} shows the home screen for a logged in user. There is a list of workspaces, along with their descriptions. In addition, there is a form for the user to create a new workspace. Any pending invitations appear in the user's sidebar.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{workspaces}
       \caption{Home screen for a user, showing all their workspaces and invitations.}
       \label{fig:workspaces}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:channels} shows the layout for a user once they have entered a workspace. The public and private channels are listed first, along with an eye icon or lock icon, indicating that the channel is public or private respectively. There is also a form for a user to create additional channels. Below is the list of all users in the workspace, along with an chess piece icon indicating whether or not that user is an admin (king for admins, and pawn for regular users). Clicking on a username will proceed to open the direct channel to communicate with that user. If the logged in user is an admin, they will also have the ability to promote any existing user to admin. The last item is a link to a page containing a form that allows an admin to invite more users to the workspace, which is only available to admins, of course.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{channels}
       \caption{A page showing all the channels and users in workspace job.}
       \label{fig:channels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Chat Application}

The chat application is run on the client side, and uses a websocket connection to the server to receive messages in real-time. This allows the client to send and receive messages without having to reload the webpage. Websocket events handlers on the server access the database the retrieve the requested messages, and send back the results in JSON to the chat app. \Cref{fig:chatting} shows the interface for the chat application.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{chatting}
       \caption{Chatting in a channel with the React app.}
       \label{fig:chatting}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Security}
Before a user is able to access any endpoint on the server, the user must first authenticate themselves with the server. This creates a server-side session which is checked on every request. If a user tries to access a workspace or channel that they are not a member of, the user will return an HTTP 404 error indicating to the client that the resource does not exist.

SQL injection is prevented by using prepared statements with \textbf{pymysql}. Additionally, cross-site scripting (XSS) is not an issue, since the only user input that is allowed to have special characters is messages, and the messages are rendered with React which automatically prevents XSS.
